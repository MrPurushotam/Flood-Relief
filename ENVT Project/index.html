            India experiences floods every year due to factors such as variations in rainfall, inadequate river capacities, river bank erosion, and poor natural drainage. The country suffers significant economic losses and loss of human life due to floods. High intensity rainfall events have increased in recent years, leading to flash floods. Urban flooding has also become common due to storm water drainage congestion. These events have drawn attention to the need for comprehensive flood management plans and policies.

            The Rashtriya Barh Ayog (RBA) estimated that 40 million hectares of land in India is liable to floods. On average, floods claim 1654 human lives and 618248 cattle lives annually. Around 1.2 million houses are damaged by floods and the average annual losses in monetary terms are Rs 5649 crores.

            Flood prone states include Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka and Maharashtra. Kerala also received significant rainfall in 2018 causing widespread floods and damage.

            According to a survey average losses caused by flood from 1953 to 2018 are shown below

        <h2 class="bold two-head">Flood prone States</h2>
        <p class="align two">The Ganga-Yamuna basin states of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal are prone to floods. Assam is also affected by floods in the Brahmaputra river. The delta parts of river basins in Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, and Gujarat are also identified as flood-prone. Recently, the upper reaches of river basins in Karnataka and Maharashtra have experienced severe floods. Kerala also received significant rainfall in 2018 causing widespread floods. Peninsular India faces flood situations during the retreating NE monsoon cyclones in October-November.</p>

        <h2 class="bold three-head">Impact  of  Climate  Change  on  probability  of  flood</h2>
        <p class="align three">Climate change has had a significant impact on the economy, leading to social, environmental, and economic losses. Frequent and unexpected flooding is one of the worst outcomes of climate change. Climate change has intensified natural events by modifying precipitation patterns, aggravating flood incidences in both coastal and landlocked regions.<br>
        
        </p>
        <ol class="align">
            <p class="align three-list-head">Broadly, climate change can exacerbate the flood situation in two-fold manner:</p>
            <li>Sea level rise due to melting glaciers can submerge coastal areas, degrade fresh water resources, destroy coastal communities, and impair the economy. This can affect agriculture, industry, and tourism sectors.</li>
            <li>Climate change has caused an increase in the frequency of short-duration heavy rainfall, leading to higher water run-off. Global warming can result in an increase in total rainfall coupled with a decrease in rainy days. Steady rainfall with distributed rainy days may be replaced by flashy and momentous rainfall, adding a large amount of water in a short span of time and leading to disasters.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="align">Natural disasters have a huge economic cost attached to them, and floods are the most economically damaging climate impact. According to a report published by the Asian Development Bank, floods account for more than half of climate-related disasters in India and caused damages of $54.63 billion during 1990-2017. The worst flood in Kerala in 2018 led to estimated losses of US$ 4.25 billion and displaced over 800,000 people in the region. It has also been estimated that a one percent increase in floods can reduce economic growth by 2.7%. The rising intensity of floods due to climate change calls for urgent action by government functionaries to be well prepared to handle the aggravated situation of floods in the country.</p>
        <p class="align">Aftermaths of flood are struck across different sectors. By means of the flood protection measures transportation network, power-transmission lines, amenities of civic communities and the bio-diversity in forest and non-forest land are saved from the peril.  The  custodian  agencies  of  such  sectors  may  be  encouraged  to  earmark  some  budgetary  allocations  towards  the  flood  management  initiatives,  which  will  be  instrumental  in  ensuring cross-sectoral involvement.</p>
