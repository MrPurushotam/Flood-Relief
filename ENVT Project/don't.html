                <li>Provide clean drinking water to animals.</li>
                <li>Adopt submergence tolerant varieties of crops in flood prone areas.</li>
                <li>Drain out excess water from the fields after floods.</li>
                <li>In heavily flood affected areas, select high lands for raising of community
                    nursery with short duration HYV rice varieties. After receding of flood
                    water, farmers may undertake transplanting of the same.</li>
                <li>If there is total damage of seedlings or rice crop in the main field, undertake
                    late and staggered planting with the old seedlings of the varieties if the field
                    is heavily damaged</li>
                <li>In high land situation, arhar and sesame can be selected for cultivation.</li>
                <li>Harvest the matured crops immediately on getting heavy rainfall forecast
                    and keep the harvested produce in safe place</li>
                <li>In partially affected fields, drain out excess water from rice field and apply
                    1/3rd N2 + 50% K2O as top dressing if the crop is at tillering stage</li>
                <li>Undertake direct seeding of rice with the photoinsensitive short duration
                    variety if crop is damaged due to flood</li>
                <li>If the seeds are washed away by floods, make alternate arrangement of
                    seeds.</li>
                <li>Apply excess N fertilizer to the flood affected crops after receding of flood
                    water.</li>

        <h3 class="list-head">Dont’s</h2>

                <li>Don’t leave the harvested produce in the open field.</li>
